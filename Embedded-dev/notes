The TestCode.ino file will show errors for missing files, this is normal as they are not in the git repository
All non-modified files from the in-built library for the arduino are not-included here
For TestCode.ino to work on your arduino, you must have the proper board library (arduino should download this or give you the option) and the library for the 3010x chip
